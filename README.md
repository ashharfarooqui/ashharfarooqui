## 📊 **My Data Science Philosophy**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Data → Questions → Exploration → Modeling          │
│                      ↓                               │
│  Validation ← Interpretation ← Results ← Training   │
│       ↓                                              │
│  Insights → Storytelling → Action → Impact          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Principles

1. **Curiosity First** 🔍 — Always ask "why" before jumping to solutions
2. **Data Integrity** 🛡️ — Garbage in, garbage out; prioritize quality
3. **Interpretability** 🧩 — Black boxes are the enemy; explain your models
4. **Reproducibility** 🔄 — Make your work auditable and repeatable
5. **Impact-Driven** 🎯 — Every model should solve a real problem
6. **Continuous Iteration** 🚀 — V1 is never the final version
